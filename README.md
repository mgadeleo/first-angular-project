# first-angular-project

This was made to practice/show how AngularJS can add interactivity and modularity to a static webpage. Design is very simple but that isn't the focus of this exercise.

The main feature of the app, which is showing how the tabs work, needs a local server to run. Either that or an actual website. I used npm with the http-server plugin. 

More Angular functionality might be added to the app at a later date.
